# NotQuiteThere

A programming language designed to be usable, but doesn't quite meet [Programming Puzzles and Code Golf](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/)'s specifications of valid languages.

You can install NotQuiteThere through the genric way of downloading code from GitHub (click "Clone or download" up to the right), or you can run it on the [online interpreter](https://tio.run/#nqt) thanks to @DennisMitchell!
